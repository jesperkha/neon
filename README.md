## About

Neon is a statically typed language that transpiles to C. The compiler ensures that no undefined C behaviour can occur and will generate template error handlers for unsafe and error-prone code. There are no object oriended features like classes, and data is abstracted as little as possible. Neon aims to be a simple, but powerful language that can interact with C codebases and give a more pleasant user experience. Goodbye segfaults ðŸ‘‹

You can check out the [project status](changelog.md) as well as [feature ideas](ideas.md) that may be added. If you have any recommendations for language features please feel free to create an issue.
